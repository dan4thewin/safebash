title: DD#55 — Implicit Exit Checks and Error Handling Model
status: designed

No `set -e` at runtime. The compiler inserts implicit exit checks on
every operation that can fail at runtime. Failure = nonzero exit or
runtime error (e.g., `regcomp` on dynamic pattern). `- cmd` suppresses.

## What gets checked

Anything that can fail due to external state or data:

- External commands (fork/exec → wait → check status)
- Builtins that wrap syscalls (`cd`, `echo`/`printf` via `write(2)`)
- Runtime calls that can fail on data (`regcomp` on dynamic patterns)
- Command substitution (`x=$(cmd)` — check before assignment)

## What does not get checked

- Variable assignment (`x="hello"`)
- Arithmetic evaluation (`(( x = x + 1 ))`)
- Pure string operations
- Literal regex (validated at compile time, can't fail at runtime)

## Suppression with `-`

`- cmd` suppresses the implicit check. The command runs, its exit
status is discarded. `$?` is not available after `- cmd` — reading
`$?` after `-` is a compile error. You said you don't care; you
don't get to inspect it.

## Explicit handling

Three patterns for a command that can fail:

| Pattern | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| `cmd` | Implicit check — abort on nonzero |
| `- cmd` | Suppressed — don't care, `$?` unavailable |
| `cmd \|\| action` / `if cmd` / `while cmd` | Explicit handling — `$?` available in handling position |

`$?` is scoped to the handling expression (`||` RHS, `if`/`while`
body), not available as a general-purpose variable in subsequent
statements. Furthermore, `$?` (or `$(status)`) is only valid as the
**first expression evaluated** in the handling branch — once another
command executes, the status is consumed and unavailable. This
prevents stale-status bugs where `$?` refers to something other
than the command that caused entry to the branch.

## `local` declarations

`local x=$(cmd)` — the capture's exit check fires regardless of
`local`. sash does not swallow exit codes in declaration context.
This is an explicit departure from bash, where `local` is the
command and its success masks the substitution's failure.

## Command substitution

`x=$(cmd)` — implicit check fires on cmd's exit status. If cmd
fails, the program aborts. `x` is never assigned.

`x=$(- cmd)` — suppressed. cmd runs, output captured, exit status
discarded. `x` gets whatever output cmd produced before it exited.

`x=$(cmd) || x=default` — explicit handling. If cmd fails, the
`||` branch executes.

## Pipelines

Pipefail always on (DD#20). Implicit check fires on the pipeline's
aggregate status. Per-segment suppression with `-`:

```
- cmd1 | cmd2       # cmd1 failure suppressed, cmd2 checked
cmd1 | - cmd2       # cmd1 checked, cmd2 failure suppressed
- cmd1 | - cmd2     # both suppressed
```

If any unsuppressed segment fails, the program aborts. SIGPIPE is
the programmer's responsibility — use `- cmd` on the producing
side or choose tools that don't trigger it (`sed -n 1p` over
`head -1`).

## Background processes (`cmd &`)

Exec failure (fork or exec fails) is checked — the parent aborts.
A successfully forked background process runs independently and
can outlive the sash program. `wait` is optional. If used, `wait`'s
return value follows normal implicit check rules.

## User-defined functions

### Void functions

No `return` statement, or unreachable (all paths abort or loop).
Bare call at call site is fine — no check needed.

### Non-void functions

Any `return` statement makes the function non-void. Call sites must
explicitly handle the return value:

- `if myfunc` / `myfunc || handle` — explicit handling
- `- myfunc` — suppressed
- bare `myfunc` — **compile error** (unhandled non-void return)

`return 0` alone is a compile error — if the only possible return
is zero, the `return` is ceremony. Omit it (void function).

### Bare call of int-typed function

Compile error. If the function returns a value, capture it or
handle it. A bare call discards the return value.

### `return $?`

Valid only in handling position: `cmd || return $?`. Propagates
the failure to the caller, making the function non-void, which
requires explicit handling at every call site.

`- cmd; return $?` is a compile error — `$?` is unavailable
after `-`.

## Comparison with bash `set -e`

Bash `set -e` has known blind spots:

- Functions called from `if` lose errexit for their entire body
- `local x=$(cmd)` swallows exit codes
- `(( 0 ))` kills the script
- Subshells inherit errexit inconsistently

sash has none of these. Checks are inserted per-operation by the
compiler. Condition position is recognized syntactically. `local`
doesn't swallow. Arithmetic doesn't produce exit codes.
